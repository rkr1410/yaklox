Yet Another Kotlin interpreter for Lox, (almost) as described in the excellent ['Crafting Interpreters'](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book.

Scanner, parser and an interpreter, developed as an exercise in getting to know Kotlin. Which means it going to be mostly Java-like at start, and then (hopefully) more and more idiomatic as time flows.

Code is commented not only on the trying-to-understand-language-design, but also getting-to-know-kotlin stuff, starting with commit 1.

Robert Nystrom's book is a serendipitous find for the less patient. Perfect if you ever wanted to craft a language but always failed - falling asleep halfway through academic treatises. Seriously, give it a go.
